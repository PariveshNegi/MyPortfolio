        <div class="lecture">
            <h2>Lecture 1: Importance of PESE</h2>
            <p>Sir wants us to work hard and stay disciplined because our parents have put a lot of effort and money into our education. He is strict because he wants us to do our best and be ready for the challenges of life. He also teaches us to love ourselves, which helps us aim for success. Even though he pushes us, it‚Äôs because he wants us to become strong and capable for the future. His lessons remind us to be thankful for our parents and take responsibility for our own growth.</p>

            <h2>Lecture 2: Confidence in Interviews</h2>
            <p>Sir emphasized how important it is to stay confident during an interview. He advised us to believe in ourselves and our abilities. He encouraged us to think of the company we‚Äôre applying to as if it‚Äôs our own, showing care and responsibility. This way, we can impress the interviewers and show them we‚Äôre the right fit for the job. Confidence and a positive attitude can help us succeed!</p>

            <h2>Lecture 3: Honesty in Interviews</h2>
            <p>It is crucial to maintain honesty during interviews, as validation checks are conducted to verify claims made by candidates. Any false information can backfire and harm credibility. Apart from technical expertise, strong communication, adaptability, and interpersonal skills play a significant role in career growth and professional success. Sir also highlighted the importance of smart bluffing over reckless bluffing. While minor exaggerations can sometimes help in presenting oneself confidently, outright falsehoods in resumes or interviews can be easily caught and damage one's reputation.</p>
